# DESCRIPTION 
During my internship, I worked on a project called File Integrity Checker. The main goal of this project was to create a tool that could help users make sure their files haven’t been changed or tampered with. In today’s digital world, data is extremely important, and even a small modification in a file can cause serious problems. This tool was designed to ensure that files remain exactly as they are, whether for personal use, work projects, or professional environments.
The way this tool works is by using a concept called hashing. Hashing is a method that takes a file and creates a unique digital fingerprint for it. Even if a single character in the file is changed, the fingerprint completely changes as well. For this project, I used popular hashing algorithms like SHA-256, which are reliable and secure. The tool stores the hash of each file and later compares it with the current hash whenever the user wants to check the file. This makes it easy to detect any changes, accidental or malicious, in the files.
I developed the project using Python, which is very flexible and works on both macOS and Windows. Python also has strong libraries for handling files and performing cryptography, which made building this tool easier. The tool has a simple command-line interface (CLI) that lets the user choose files or even entire folders to monitor. It then generates hash values for all selected files and stores them securely. Whenever the user wants to verify the files, the program compares the stored hash with the new hash and alerts the user if any changes are detected.
One of the things I focused on while building this tool was making it simple and user-friendly. Even someone who doesn’t know much about programming or cybersecurity can use it easily. Clear prompts guide the user through every step, from selecting files to seeing the results. I also made sure the tool can run on both Mac and Windows, which makes it versatile for different users.
Working on this project gave me practical experience in cybersecurity concepts, especially the importance of file integrity. File integrity checking is widely used in industries like banking, healthcare, and software development to protect sensitive data. By building this tool, I learned how small changes in files can affect security and why monitoring files is important for any organization.
During the development process, I faced challenges like handling large files efficiently, ensuring accurate hash calculations, and making the program easy to use. I solved these challenges by breaking the project into small modules, writing clear and organized code, and testing the tool thoroughly. I also made sure to include error handling, so the tool works smoothly even if something goes wrong, like a missing file or incorrect input.
In short, the File Integrity Checker is a practical and educational project that combines Python programming with cybersecurity principles. It helps ensure that files remain safe and unchanged, which is a very important part of information security. Through this project, I not only improved my programming skills but also gained valuable knowledge about how security tools work in real-world applications. I feel this project is a great example of an internship-level task that is both useful and demonstrates technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and attention to detail.
